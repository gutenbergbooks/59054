<h3>I<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></h3>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>I can conceive of nothing worse than
a man-governed world&mdash;except a woman-governed
world.</i>&#8221;</p>


<p class="drop-cap">I KNOW that this welcome has
nothing to do with me. Ever
since I first entered the Mother of
Parliaments I realised that I had
ceased to be a person and had become
a symbol. The safe thing about being
a symbol is this&mdash;you realise that
you of yourself can do nothing, but
what you symbolise gives you courage
and strength, and should give you
wisdom. I certainly have been given
courage and strength. I won&#8217;t say
too much about wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>My entrance into the House of
Commons was not, as some thought,
in the nature of a revolution. It was
simply evolution. It is interesting
how it came about. My husband
was the one who started me off on this
downward career&mdash;from home to the
House. If I have helped the cause of
women, he is the one to thank&mdash;not
me. He is a strange and remarkable
man. First, it was strange to urge
his wife to take up public life, especially
as he is a most domesticated
creature; but the truth is, he is a born
social reformer. He has avoided the
pitfalls which so many well-to-do men
fall into. He doesn&#8217;t think that you
can right wrongs with philanthropy.
He realises that you must go to the
bottom of the causes of wrongs and
not simply gild over the top. For
eleven years I had helped him with his
work at Plymouth. Mine was the
personal side. I found out the wrongs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and he tried to right them. It was a
wonderful and happy combination,
and I often wish that it was still going
on. However, I am not here to tell
you of his work, but it is interesting
in so far as it shows you how it came
about that I stood for Parliament at
all. Unless he had been the kind of
man that he was, I don&#8217;t believe that
the first woman Member of the oldest
Parliament in the world would have
come from Plymouth&mdash;and that would
have been a pity.</p>

<p>Plymouth is an ideal port to sail
from or to. It has bidden &#8220;God
Speed&#8221; to so many voyagers. I felt
that I was embarking on a voyage of
faith, but when I arrived at my destination
some of the Honourable
Members looked upon me more as a
pirate than a Pilgrim! A woman in
the House of Commons! It was almost
enough to have broken up the
House. I don&#8217;t blame them, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was as hard on the woman as it was
on them. Pioneers may be picturesque
figures, but they are often
rather lonely ones. I must say though,
for the House of Commons, they bore
their shock with dauntless decency.
No body of men could have been
kinder and fairer than they were.
When you hear people over here trying
to run down England, please remember
that England first gave the
vote to women, and that the men of
England welcomed an American-born
woman in the House with a fairness
and justice which this woman, at
least, will never forget.</p>

<p>Different Members received me in
different ways. I shall never forget a
Scottish Labour man coming up to me,
after I had been in the House a little
time, and telling me that I wasn&#8217;t a
bit the sort of woman he thought I
was going to be; and on being pressed
as to what kind of woman he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
I would be, said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll not tell you
that, but I know now that you are an
ordinary, homely kind of woman&#8221;;
and he has proved it since by often
asking my advice on domestic questions.
Then the Irishman&mdash;an Irish
Member once said to me, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know what you are going to speak
about, but I am here to back you.&#8221;
The last was a regular old Noah&#8217;s Ark
man, a typical English Squire type.
After two years and a half of never
agreeing on any point with me, he remarked
to someone that I &#8220;was a very
stupid woman, but he must add, a
very attractive one,&#8221; and he feared I
was a thoroughly honest social reformer.
I might add that, being the
first woman, I had to take up many
causes which no one would call exactly
popular. I also had to go against
the prejudice of generations, but I
must say their courtesy has never
failed, though my Parliamentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
manners must have been somewhat
of a trial.</p>

<p>Now I must leave the more personal
side and get to what it is all about, and
why we are here.</p>

<p>Some women have always been in
politics, and not done badly either.
It was when we had the Lancastrian
kings that it was said that kings were
made by Act of Parliament&mdash;they
ruled by means of Parliament. Then
Henry VIII accepted the principle of
the Lancastrians to rule by Parliament,
but he used that principle in
an entirely different way. He made
Parliament the engine of his will, he
pressed or frightened it into doing
anything he wished. Under his guidance
Parliament defied and crushed
all other powers spiritual and temporal,
and he did things which no king
or Parliament had ever attempted to
do, things unheard of and terrible.
Then Elizabeth came along. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
true she scolded her Parliaments for
meddling with matters with which,
in her opinion, they had no concern,
and more than once soundly rated the
Speaker of the Commons, but she
never carried her quarrels too far, and
was able to end her disputes by clever
compromise; in other words, she never
let Parliament down, and that is what
I don&#8217;t believe any wise woman will
do, in spite of the fears of some of the
men.</p>

<p>Now why are we in politics? What
is it all about? Something much bigger
than ourselves. Schopenhauer
was wrong in nearly everything he
wrote about women&mdash;and he wrote a
lot&mdash;but he was right in one thing.
He said, in speaking of women, &#8220;The
race is to her more than the individual,&#8221;
and I believe that it is true. I
feel somehow we do care about the
race as a whole; our very natures
makes us take a forward vision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
There is no reason why women should
look back. Mercifully, we have no
political past; we have all the mistakes
of one-sex legislation, with its
appalling failures, to guide us. We
should know what to avoid. It is no
use blaming the men&mdash;we made them
what they are&mdash;and now it is up to us
to try and make ourselves&mdash;the makers
of men&mdash;a little more responsible.
We realise that no one sex can govern
alone. I believe that one of the reasons
why civilisation has failed so
lamentably is that it has had one-sided
government. Don&#8217;t let us make
the mistake of ever allowing that to
happen again. I can conceive of
nothing worse than a man-governed
world&mdash;except a woman-governed
world&mdash;but I can see the combination
of the two going forward, and making
civilisation, more worthy of the name
of civilisation based on Christianity,
not on force&mdash;a civilisation based on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
justice and mercy. I feel men have a
greater sense of justice, and we of
mercy. They must borrow our mercy
and we must use their justice.</p>

<p>We are new brooms. Let us see that
we sweep the right rooms. Personally,
I feel that every woman should
take an active part in local government.
I don&#8217;t mean by that, that
every woman should go in for a political
career&mdash;that, of course, would be
absurd; but you can take an active
part in local government without going
in for a political career. You can
be certain when casting your vote that
you are casting it for what seems
nearest right&mdash;for what seems more
likely to help the majority and not to
bolster up an organised minority.
There is a lot to be done in local politics,
and it is a fine apprenticeship for
central government; it is very practical,
but I think that, although practical,
it is too near to be attractive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
The things that are far away are more
apt to catch our imagination than the
ones which are just under our noses,
and then, they are often less disagreeable.</p>

<p>Political development is like all
other development. We must begin
with ourselves, our own consciousness,
and clean out our own hearts before
we take on the job of putting others
straight. So with politics. If we
women put our hands to local politics,
we must begin with the foundations.
After all, central governments only
echo local ones; the politician in
Washington, if he is a wise man, will
always have one eye on his constituency.
Let us make that constituency
so clean, so straight, so high in its purpose,
that the man from home will not
dare to take a small, limited view
about any question, be it a national
or an international one. You must
remember that what women are up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
against is not what they see, but the
unseen forces. We are up against
generations and generations of prejudice.
Ever since Eve ate the apple&mdash;but
I would like to remind you, and
all men, why she ate the apple. It
was not simply because it was good
for food or pleasant to the eyes: it
was from a tree whose fruit would
make one wise&mdash;&#8220;She took of the
fruit thereof and did eat, and gave
unto her husband with her and he did
eat.&#8221; We have no record of Adam
murmuring against the fruit&mdash;of his
doing anything but eat it with docility.
In passing, also, I would like to
say that the first time Adam had a
chance he laid the blame on woman&mdash;however,
we will leave Adam.</p>

<p>Ever since woman&#8217;s consciousness
has looked beyond the material, man&#8217;s
consciousness has feared her vaguely;
he has gone to her for inspiration, he
has relied on her for all that is best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and most ideal in his life, yet by sheer
material force he has limited her.
The Western man has, without knowing
it, Westernised the harem mind of
the East. I don&#8217;t believe he knows
it yet, so we must break it to him
gently. We must go on being his
guide, his mother, and his better half.
But we must prove to him that we are
a necessary half, not only in private,
but in political life. The best way
that we can do that is to show him
that our ambitions are not personal.
Let men see that we desire a better,
safer, and cleaner world for our children
and their children, and that we
believe that it is only by doing our bit,
by facing unclean things with cleanliness,
by facing wrongs with right, by
going fearlessly into all things that
may be disagreeable, that we will,
somehow, make this a little better
world. I don&#8217;t know that we are
going to do this&mdash;I don&#8217;t say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
women will change the world, but I
do say that they can if they want to.
Coming, as I do, from the Old World
which has seen a devastating war, I
cannot face the future without this
hope&mdash;that the women of all countries
will do their duty and raise a generation
of men and women who will look
upon war and all that leads to it with
as much horror as we now look upon
a cold-blooded murder. If we want
this new world, we can get it only by
striving for it; and the real struggle
will be within ourselves, to put out of
our hearts and of our thoughts, all
that makes for war, hate, envy, greed,
pride, force, and material ambition.</p>

<h3>II<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></h3>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>I seem a symbol&mdash;a sort of connecting
link between the English-speaking people!</i>&#8221;</p>


<p class="drop-cap">I AM not really afraid to speak here
to-night. I was a little afraid last
night&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know quite whether
New York audiences would be as kind
as Plymouth audiences. I see that
they are much the same. They forgive
any shortcomings in the way of
scholarly attainments or oratorical
orations when they see that you are
speaking from your heart. I usually
do speak from my heart. It has been
a safer guide to me than my head, and
here to-night it&#8217;s easy; for surely no
people on earth have understood a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
woman&#8217;s heart better than the English-speaking
nations.</p>

<p>Last night I told the Women Voters
that I was not a person, but a symbol;
to-night I still seem a symbol&mdash;a sort
of connecting link between the English-speaking
people, a frail link,
perhaps, but a link that is stronger
than it looks. It is a strange thing
that England&#8217;s first woman Member
of Parliament should have come
from England&#8217;s first colony. I doubt
if the first English woman to land in
Virginia was less expected on these
shores, than the first Virginian woman
to land in the House of Commons was
expected on that floor. However, in
spite of having neither beads nor fire-water,
the natives were amazingly
kind to that Virginian settler. It is
all very picturesque when one thinks
of it historically, but it seems very
ordinary when it is done. History, I
think, is more romantic to read than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to make, and I apologise now to future
little schoolgirls for having added
another question to the endless ones
which still haunt me when my mind
turns back to the long list of historical
personages, varying from Lucretia
Borgia down to Susan B. Anthony.</p>

<p>I have been asked what my visit
here was for. Cannot a person come
home without being suspected of deep
and ulterior motives? I may tell you
at once, I am not on a mission to promote
a better understanding between
England and America. No person,
however keen about it, can do much
in that line. Things which are worth
while are made by something better
than missions or treaties. They are
made only by great ideals in the
hearts of the common people.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe that trade agreements
will succeed in promoting a
better understanding. But I do say
that if the greatest commonwealth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
nations the world has ever seen and
the greatest federation of states the
world has ever known cannot be
brought together by some common
cause, some human hope and purpose,
then I, personally, should feel like
the Queen of Sheba&mdash;the spirit would
go out of me. I do believe that these
two nations are bound together by a
common cause; and that cause, one
of human hope and purpose, is peace
on earth and good-will toward all
men.</p>

<p>The Washington Conference was
not a surprise to me. I knew that
England was not a militarist nation
any more than America was, and I
knew, too, that once they talked
things over they would see the utter
futility of building battleships against
one another. America and England
should have the largest fleets because
they will certainly use them more as
policemen than as fighting forces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
After all, when England had the
greatest navy in the world she never
used it except to keep the freedom of
the seas. I often wonder whether
Imperialist Germany might not have
treated the Monroe Doctrine like a
scrap of paper had her fleet been the
strongest in the world. However, I
don&#8217;t want to go back to an ancient
grudge. It&#8217;s hopeless trying to go
forward when you are looking backward.
It is a great mistake to keep
such things alive; it only means
trouble, and surely there is enough
trouble in the world now without
looking backward.</p>

<p>America, I am told, draws back
with horror when she looks at Europe.
I don&#8217;t blame her. Certainly,
it is a sad enough sight to make one
draw back. I cannot believe, though,
that standing back is the right way to
help, and I don&#8217;t believe that any
part of the world can go forward in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the truest sense while another part is
suffering desperately. The war has
shown us that the world is really
round and is part interdependent. I
am struck more and more by the way
in which our stock of moral good-will
on both sides is still thwarted by the
extent of our misunderstanding.</p>

<p>This not only hinders the recovery
of hundreds of millions of people from
all the mischiefs of war, but works new
mischief of its own. I am thinking
now, not so much of America and
Britain, who have had their heart-to-heart
explanations at the Washington
Conference, with an effect which
ought to make their relations foolproof,
in spite of the small people
who are so blinded by their fear or
envy and hate, that they would do all
in their power to pull them apart.
But I am not afraid of them. I am
only sorry for them. There is nothing
more pitiful than people who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
moved by envy or hate, and there is
nothing weaker than people who fear.
Envy and hate are the most blinding
things on earth; it is only people
with vision who never perish. When
I talk of misunderstanding I am
thinking of Europe.</p>

<p>I know that both America and
England feel that Europe is not getting
on with the peace, that she still
has large armies, still fights, and at
the same time cries out for help.
Russia and France still have great
armies, and this naturally makes
smaller states arm too. Of course it
is all desperately disappointing to
some of us. We had hoped that this
was a war to end wars&mdash;I think it has
ended the biggest wars, yet there seem
to be a few small private wars going
on, and still a great deal of fear and
hatred left. I am sure that you will
never end war with wars.</p>

<p>I believe that the safest and surest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
way to get out of war is to join some
sort of league of nations. That misrepresented
and much despised League
has already prevented three small
wars, it has registered over one hundred
treaties, has repatriated nearly
four hundred thousand prisoners&mdash;not
a bad record for only half a league.
I think it is enough to make every
woman in America want to join it in
some form or other, certainly any of
those who have had sons in the war.
It is the memory of the anguish of the
mothers and fathers who watched for
four years which gives me the courage
to speak plainly here to-night. You
see, the anguish in a mother&#8217;s heart is
felt in all other mothers&#8217; hearts over
the world, even though they be enemy
mothers. If this is true, mothers in
any country can be members. I was
told to be careful. Why careful? Of
what? I have not anything to say
that could hurt any one in America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and I only want to try and help the
thousands of people in less fortunate
countries than America. Anyhow, I
do believe that America likes people
to say what they mean and care
about.</p>

<p>No one could say that America does
not care about Europe. Look at the
way the American Relief Committee
is helping Russia. It is the admiration
of the whole of England; often
I have heard it referred to in the
House of Commons. Yet I don&#8217;t believe
that the greatest philanthropy in
the world can add much to the permanent
reconstruction of the world,
and that is what the world needs more
now than anything&mdash;reconstruction.
It is all very well to hear people talk
of European entanglements, but the
world is already tangled, and we have
to think of a plan to disentangle ourselves.
No one could think that
English fathers and mothers&mdash;with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
nearly eight hundred thousand sons
who will never return&mdash;would want to
join in a League which would entangle
them or any one else in war. The
English know enough about wars
never to want to fight or to see any one
else have to fight. These mothers
and fathers think, as I feel sure the
fathers and mothers of America do,
that the safest and sanest way to get
out of wars is to join some sort of
association of nations for peace.
The Washington Conference shows us
what can happen when great countries
with great ideals get together.
The difference between people with
ideals and people without is simply
the difference between Pagans and
Christians&mdash;a Pagan is a man whose
standard of right does not extend
beyond his own interest. Now we
Anglo-Saxons rather pride ourselves
that our civilisation was built on
Christianity. If that is the case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
there is no doubt that a lot of Pagans
have slipped in among us&mdash;perhaps
they have also been proselytising.
Don&#8217;t let us proselytise too far, don&#8217;t
let us forget the faith of our forefathers.
It must have taken a tremendous
faith mixed with a double
dose of courage to have crossed the
Atlantic in a shell of a boat&mdash;yet they
did. They were not Pagans. Civilisation
has been nearly destroyed by
Pagans. We cannot give them a
second chance. It is wonderfully
helpful to look back and see the kind
of men in all countries who have made
civilisation. They were not men who
carried a grudge, they were not men
who hated, but men with an inner
consciousness of what man really is
capable of, men who realised that life
is redeemed only by a purpose bigger
than themselves, and a love which
passes all understanding.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>We must put into public life those
qualities which women have had to put into
their home life.</i>&#8221;</p>


<p class="drop-cap">IT seems a strange thing to be here&mdash;but
my life is a little like that
of Alice in Wonderland. It gets
curiouser and curiouser. When I sailed
from Plymouth to the House of Commons,
I may tell you frankly I didn&#8217;t
half realise what the voyage would be
like. I soon discovered that it was
the kind of voyage which would take
the spiritual faith of the Pilgrim
Fathers and the courage of Sir Francis
Drake. They both sailed from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
port, and I have had to use both their
courage and their faith.</p>

<p>However, I think women possess
both courage and faith. When I
speak of women I don&#8217;t mean every
woman, I mean real women, women
who care about real things&mdash;the sort
of women who have not only borne
men, but have given them such unselfish
love that the world has seen,
through them, a bit of what the love
of God is like.</p>

<p>Now, if we possess courage and
faith, it will be no use to us unless we
use it. Faith is like a belief&mdash;it is
only helpful if it leads us to knowledge.
Belief in God will only help us if it
leads us to knowledge of God.</p>

<p>So we women must turn to account
some of this courage and faith. We
must put into public life these qualities
which women have had to and
which they have rejoiced to put in
their home life&mdash;unselfishness, cleanliness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and kindness. The world needs
it. I don&#8217;t suppose the world as a
whole was ever more in need of kindness
than it is now.</p>

<p>We need not ask ourselves why the
world needs help. You have got to
cast your mind over the world and
you will get the answer. Europe
partly devastated and still hating.
Russia starving; Capital and Labour,
like nations, almost as far apart as
ever before. I suppose this must be
the aftermath of war. You can&#8217;t let
Hell loose on earth for four years,
and expect to find Paradise at the end.</p>

<p>Yet when I speak of war, I don&#8217;t
mean that it was all hell. There was
one aspect of war which was better
than anything I have found in the
aftermath of war. There was a sort
of kindliness and pulling together
among all classes of the population,
and one felt that at last a Brotherhood
of Men was coming about. At least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that is how it was in England, and I
feel certain that it must have been
the same over here.</p>

<p>A common purpose shared by a
whole nation, if that purpose is one of
sacrifice, idealism, and helpfulness, is
a wonderful thing. Think what a
common purpose shared by many nations&mdash;a
purpose with an ideal and
helpfulness and a sacrifice of self&mdash;would
be. This is what the war
should have left&mdash;and even though, I
admit, it is not obvious, I cannot help
believing that that common purpose
remains&mdash;remains anyhow in the
hearts of those who suffered and in the
hearts of those who care.</p>

<p>I cannot speak for the women of
Europe, but I think I can speak for
the women of England, and I say
that they, through suffering, have
determined that so far as within them
lies, there is no sacrifice too great to
make for the cause of peace. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
seen the women of England when they
were determined. I have seen them
tried and not found wanting. I can
tell you it was a glorious sight. You
may read diaries of the war which tell
of dinner parties and plenty in London;
but that no more represents the
women of England than a night
dancing-club in New York or a red-light
district in some city here represents
the women of America.</p>

<p>I will tell you what the spirit of
English women was and is: The
Bishop of Exeter, Lord Robert Cecil&#8217;s
brother, had two splendid boys killed
in the first three years of the war.
The last year of the war 2,000 American
Submarine Chaser sailors were
stationed in Plymouth, which is in
the Bishop&#8217;s diocese. His wife, Lady
Florence, did everything she could to
make these American boys less lonely.
She had as many as she could for
Christmas, and hardly ever was her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
house without some of them. About
January, 1918, just before one of the
fiercest battles, she said to her sister:
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I could go on if Jack
(her last son) was taken.&#8221; The next
morning a wire came saying Jack was
killed. This was on a Monday. On
Thursday, Lady Florence had planned
an afternoon party for your sons&mdash;those
gallant submarine chasers.
When she arrived at Plymouth, and I
saw her white, stricken face, I begged
her not to have the boys&mdash;they would
just remind her of Jack as he had
been. She looked at me with eyes I
can never forget and said: &#8220;But,
Nancy, they too are far away from
home, and we must do all we can.&#8221;
The party went off and the boys,
never guessing her sorrow, were
charmed as usual with the Bishop
and his wife&#8217;s cheerful kindness. That
night I walked around to the American
Y. M. C. A., and in talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to some of the boys told them of Lady
Florence&#8217;s sorrow. One boy, with
tears in his eyes, broke out: &#8220;Oh, why
did you let her do it?&#8221; Then he said:
&#8220;If ever any one speaks ill to me of
England, I don&#8217;t feel that I could keep
from killing them.&#8221; That, friends,
was the spirit of the women of England.
Suffering only made them kinder
and braver, and that&#8217;s why I love
and admire England.</p>

<p>Now, what can we do&mdash;the English-speaking
women of the world? And
I cannot help feeling that we have got
most all of the women with us&mdash;but
what can we do to help the whole
world on? We cannot live for ourselves
alone and get peace. We cannot
even get happiness, and I doubt
whether we can get plenty. We must
somehow rectify the mistakes of the
stronger sex when left alone, and we
must do it soon.</p>

<p>When America came into the war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Europe saw the dawn of a new hope&mdash;America
in the war to end wars.
When America went out of the peace
Europe was dumbfounded. Idealism
took America into the war; idealism
did not take her out of the peace, no
matter what politicians say.</p>

<p>The League of Nations was started
by America, and by an American.
Some seem to think only of the
starter, and forget it was the high
purpose of his people who gave the
impetus which brought the League
from America to Europe. When we
go for a great ideal we go for the
ideal and not for the idealist. It&#8217;s a
principle we should follow and not be
side-tracked by a personality. Let us
see what the League, even without
America, Germany, and Russia, has
done already. If we realise some of
its achievements we may be inspired
to give it greater trust, and add to its
number of associated nations. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
League of Nations, quite apart from
its political work, has active humanitarian
sections dealing with health,
labour conditions, traffic in opium and
drugs, and the White Slave Traffic.
Each one of these must surely find
hundreds of thousands of women
backers in the United States. We
want your help inside the League to
bring on backward countries, whether
it be to protect the world from war
or from plagues, or to protect young
girls from what is worse than plagues.</p>

<p>But I have not come here as a
foreigner to tell any one&mdash;be it man,
senator, or woman voter&mdash;what to do.
You have invited me to an American
Convention. You have not asked
me because I am an English legislator.
But you have invited me back to the
land of my birth&mdash;to the Home of my
father, from the Home of my forefathers,
and, like the returned prodigal,
you overwhelm me with love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Yes, it is true I have been in a far
country. I believe I have been fighting
there for the same ideals that Mrs.
Catt has worked so successfully for
here. I am deeply grateful that you
should have asked me to come and discuss
with you questions which interest
all women.</p>

<p>As I understand it, you, in the
League of Women Voters, are not
creating a new party&mdash;a woman&#8217;s
party&mdash;to run sex candidates in opposition
to the Democratic and Republican
party candidates. Some people
fear you want to do this. I am sure
you are right not to do so. I did not
stand for Parliament as a sex candidate.
I represent a Division of Plymouth&mdash;one
of the most important
naval ports of England. Thousands
of my supporters are English sailors.
But this does not prevent me fighting,
and fighting hard, for questions where
there is a woman&#8217;s point of view&mdash;questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of morality, the protection
of young girls.</p>

<p>Some men don&#8217;t like it. But the
best men&mdash;a growing number of men,
I find&mdash;are supporting me.</p>

<p>You are right not to make a new
political party. You are equally right
to try to lift and raise and improve
the platforms of both the big political
parties by joining them. See that you
send neither windbags nor carpetbaggers
to represent you.</p>

<p>The big contribution you can make
to politics and national life is to face
and tackle the moral standard. Insist
upon a single standard of morality&mdash;not
by lowering our standard;
but by raising the men&#8217;s standard to
that of women. Do that in America.
We are working for it in England. If
America and England do it, then all
countries must follow. In some countries
women are still looked upon too
much as mere physical instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
mental companions. It is partly the
fault of the women. They will always
be that until they get a higher sense
of companionship. The right-minded
women want to be companions in the
truest sense of the word, and the
right-minded men want to have them
so. It is easy enough to attract men;
it is harder to help them. The single
moral standard not only helps women,
it helps men; <i>it helps nations</i>.</p>

<p>You cannot be material in your
domestic life and be spiritual in your
national life. You cannot be material
in your national life and be
idealistic in your international relations.
Lust creates the spirit of War;
it is incompatible with the spirit of
Peace. The material man lives and
dies. It is the spiritual man who
never dies. So with nations. No
material nations, however powerful,
have ever survived.</p>

<p>The peace which the world wants is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
not the peace which comes from a
smashing conquest&mdash;that sort of peace
is apt to sow the seeds of vengeance.
I believe the women can help to
bring to the world the real peace&mdash;the
spiritual peace&mdash;the Peace which
passeth all understanding.</p>

<p>Always remember St. Paul&#8217;s words;
they apply particularly to women:
&#8220;God hath not given us the spirit of
fear, but of power and of love and of
a sound mind.&#8221; We can only bring
this spirit into world politics if we
have got it in our hearts. Let us
prove to all nations that we are not
only talkers, but doers.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I DO not know who has been kinder
to me since I got home, the public
or the Press. I do know that if
the Press had not been so kind the
public would never have been. I
knew that when I came home there
would be some personal friends and
relations who would be glad to see
me, and then I knew there would be
some people who, because of my
political views, would be glad to see
me. But I did not expect what I got.
I did not expect this tidal wave of
welcome. You have swept me off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
my feet.</p>

<p>When a person leaves his or her own
country and goes to another, naturally
there&#8217;s apt to be a prejudice against
them in both countries. I felt it myself.
Then when that person&mdash;I can&#8217;t
say unfortunate person&mdash;happens to
care deeply about both countries, and
even more deeply about things concerning
all countries, her task is not
made easier. It&#8217;s easy enough to
take the easy way in any country.
It&#8217;s not always so easy to take what
you feel is the right way in any country,
but here I am&mdash;a proof to all
countries that England and America
will give you a chance if you can
prove to either of them that what you
are striving for is something which
will hurt no man, woman, or child of
any country, but which you earnestly
feel is going to help all countries.</p>

<p>Now you will ask&mdash;What is this
pearl of great price? What does this
woman think will help all countries?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
I&#8217;ll tell you what is the pearl of great
price that I am striving for. I am
striving to take into public life what
any man gets from his mother and
most men get from their wives if they
chose wisely. The kind of thing you
have had in your home life, the kind
of thing that has made it possible for
you to be here to-day is the unselfishness,
the courage, and the vision and
the clean love of your mother. That
quality has done more than anything
in the world to make up civilisation.
Men know that and we women know
it, too; and we feel that if we can
get a little of that into public life,
that is our only contribution. That
is the only thing we have got. We
are not coming just as women.
Women are of no more use than men.
It is what we bring that is going to be
useful, and a great many of us think
that we have more moral courage
sometimes than men. Women know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that physical courage is easy enough
but moral courage takes a bit of doing.
We feel that we have got moral
courage, and we know that we have
got a clean love, and we know that
we have got to be unselfish. If we
were not unselfish you would not be
here. That is the mothers&#8217; contribution
to life. We are bound to be unselfish,
and we think we have got a
great vision. It is that which we ask
you to accept. That is all we want
to do. We don&#8217;t want to go into
politics because of ourselves.</p>

<p>We realize, as we realized when we
raised you, that to make you perfect
we have to do a great many disagreeable
things; but we never flinched,
and your mothers never flinched.
They spanked you when you needed
it, and they loved you when you
needed it, and they sympathised with
you when you needed it, but a really
good mother never flinches from what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
is disagreeable, and we are not going
to flinch now. We are ready to go
into the political arena, and &#8220;arena&#8221;
well describes it. There are many
stout old Pagans prancing around in
it still. However, we are willing to
go in. We are willing to do our bit
if you will let us help. Don&#8217;t be
frightened at us and don&#8217;t discourage
us too much. We know that your
public life, just as much as your private
life, needs this mothering thought.
When you are blundering around,
sometimes a woman sees as quick on
public things as she does on private.
You men think we women talk so
much. It is true, we do; but even
then we don&#8217;t tell you half we know.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll be saying this sounds nice
and uplifting, but we must get down to
practical politics. What are practical
politics? The politics that lead to
war are not practical, and the same
things that lead to bad politics lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to war. The most practical thing in
the world is common sense and common
humanity. It is the world&#8217;s
great need to-day. Leaving aside the
vision of what a world needs, what
we need is confidence, coöperation&mdash;and
I would like to add another&mdash;conferences.
I know it is not a popular
word in America, but you need conferences.
We have tried others and
they have failed. Also, we have got
to get to work. The world wants
work. What&#8217;s the most practical
way to start work? Trade. Establish
confidence&mdash;first, confidence between
Capital and Labour, then confidence
in your government, then confidence
in other nations. The Washington
Conference showed that
coöperation and confidence were the
watchwords of progress. The employer
must realise that he&#8217;s dealing
with a human being, and the worker
must realise that the employer has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
got some quality which he needs and
lacks, otherwise the scales might be
weighted the other way. These seem
to be the essential facts which Capital
and Labour should not forget. They
were forgotten in Russia with dire results.
The fault, though, began with
the employer class in Russia. Don&#8217;t
let us forget that. Then after getting
Capital and Labour together, we
must get trade. The only solution
for unemployment is employment&mdash;for
the workless, is work. In the
modern world no big nation can get
work for all unless it trades with all.
The best way to trade with all countries
is to know all countries, and
that&#8217;s where the Press&mdash;you, gentlemen&mdash;come
in. Bring out the best
in all countries, get understanding,
confidence, good-will. You cannot
have international trade without international
confidence. Russia proves
this. Good-will is good business. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
is for the Press to unite countries for
trade and prosperity and peace.</p>

<p>Governments depend for their views
of foreign countries, upon their ambassadors.
Ambassadors get to know
foreign governments. Foreign correspondents
are unofficial ambassadors
for the people. The Press can
supplement official channels of communication
by telling the people of
each country not only about the governments
but about the peoples.
They can get the news and spread it
quickly. They can get it to the man
in the street. I know many of the
American foreign correspondents.
And I have heard frequently about
the others. They are most able men,
a credit to the American Press. They
are trustworthy. That is the opinion
formed by the people who know in
England. I am glad to be able to repeat
this opinion here to-day. If the
Press wants to unite countries it can.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
If it wants to disunite them, it can.
But the Press is just like a person in
this. If someone tells you constantly
of another&#8217;s shortcomings and faults
and extols his own virtues, you begin
sooner or later to avoid that person.
You feel, &#8220;Well, hang it all,
he&#8217;s not quite so bad as that anyhow.
I don&#8217;t like always hearing of
people&#8217;s failings. I like to hear what&#8217;s
nearest the truth about them and then
I can judge whether I like them or
not.&#8221; So it is with the Press; if it
gives us accurate, fair news, we can
judge for ourselves whether it&#8217;s white
Press or yellow. We even see that
people aren&#8217;t so stupid as they look.
Thinking people find out that facts
based on prejudice cease to be facts.
Mr. Davis told you all of this in a
far better style and manner last year.
The world has progressed a little
since he spoke to you. We must be
grateful even for this little. We must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
be deeply grateful for the Washington
Conference.</p>

<p>I believe the whole world longs for
peace. But we never get anything in
this world and we certainly never get
to heaven without striving for it.</p>

<p>America wants peace. America
started the League of Nations. All
Europe looks to America, not for
large armies, not even for food, but
for a great moral lead.</p>

<p>Lead us toward peace. Help us!
Help us! Don&#8217;t just look on our
faults&mdash;help us to be better! Gentlemen,
if we know the better way&mdash;let
us see to it that we take it.</p>

<p>Once more I beg of you to remember
your power. If only your motto
could be to unite the world, send no
thought which would not bless or
cheer, purify or heal&mdash;then we should,
as the soldiers say, &#8220;get on with the
peace.&#8221;</p>

England, namely, Plymouth.</p>

<p>It takes a good deal of prayer to
keep me humble. To be born in
Virginia and to represent Plymouth, is
enough to turn a stronger head than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
mine. The Good Book tells us to
love all men, also the greater the
loving the greater the life. I am fortunate
in loving two great countries,
but their greatness will be tested by
their attitude to lesser countries.
To-day I am speaking as a woman and
not as a Member of Parliament.
The League of Women Voters, I realise,
is not the only political league
of women in America, but it has the
merit of being non-party. I, as an
outsider, could not come over and
speak here as a party politician, but I
come as a woman, speaking to non-party
women, interested in something
bigger than any party.</p>

<p>When entering Parliament nearly
two years ago, I went as a party candidate,
a Coalition Unionist. The
Coalition was a combination of Unionists
and Liberals and Labour, who
wanted to coöperate and felt that
Lloyd George was the best man to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
win the Peace, as he had done more
than any single statesman to win the
war. When I got into the House of
Commons I realised that as for certain
problems, such as moral questions
which are of vital interest to women,
no political party cared sufficiently
or realised how much women cared.
As a result, Liberal and Unionist and
Labour men often put such questions
in their programme, but more
often they sat down when the
time came to stand up and fight
for them.</p>

<p>It is my honest and convinced belief
that there are some questions vital
and international, which women see
with a more unclouded vision than
men, questions which only women will
fight for. That is why I am so keen
about helping women voters, not only
in England and America, but in all
countries. There are things bigger
than parties, even bigger than countries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
though neither party nor country
likes to think that anything is
bigger than itself.</p>

<p>If only we, the new-comers of political
life, can keep that greater vision
of bigger things before us, then the
world will become more the sort of
place one dreams of and less the kind
of nightmare one dreams in.</p>

<p>Can we change it? Are we really
different from men? I hope so. If
we were like men, then there would be
no use giving us the vote. It is because
we are different that we hope to
help, and yet women are like men in
this. They vary! The women who
attend prize-fights, the woman who
keeps her husband&#8217;s nose to the grindstone
because of her personal demands
and vulgar ambition to outshine and
out-do her next-door neighbour, are
just as hampering to real civilisation
as the old-fashioned bar-room loafer,
and more so. That old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
bar-room bum was so obviously a
warning to all&mdash;the ambitious, selfish
wife or daughter is not so obvious;
often she&#8217;s for a time most attractive,
yet the man whose soul is striving and
who finds himself tied down to one of
these women will tell one that their
charm soon turns to dust and ashes.
So when I speak of women I only
mean real women, and real women are
the women who care for real things.
After all, it&#8217;s only people who care
about real things that have got us on
as far as we are&mdash;not very far I&#8217;ll
admit&mdash;yet we are advancing. Crass
materialism is going. The war of
1914 was just a war of ideals. Germany
said might was right&mdash;we are
mighty&mdash;we must expand&mdash;we must
govern the world. The Kaiser with
his God&#8217;s help led a misguided and
misdirected people up against the
Democracies of the World, who,
though they don&#8217;t live up to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
ideals, have at least got beyond believing
in the Divine Right of Kings.
King John of England found that out
in 1214, and the Constitution of
America was based on laws which
men fought and died for in England
long before they set sail for other
lands. I am told that I have forgotten
that Columbus discovered
America. He discovered it, but some
have forgotten that he didn&#8217;t settle it.
It&#8217;s well to remember those first settlers.
It&#8217;s always well to remember
unselfishness, courage, and determination,
and people who gave up all for a
high ideal. Now I don&#8217;t come from
Puritan stock; we in Virginia were
almost comfortably settled before the
Puritan Fathers set sail&mdash;and they
meant to land in Virginia! Yet no
one can look back on that gallant
band of men and women without
admiring and almost reverencing
them. Those are the kind of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
who make Civilisation, people who
subordinate the material to the spiritual.
They may be rare, but they are
the light which shines in darkness.
Throughout history Materialism has
wrecked Civilisation. Now I maintain
that women, just from their very
natures, must have more vision than
men. Why is it that you have just
had a Mother&#8217;s Day, not a Father&#8217;s
Day? Isn&#8217;t it because of the subtle
unnamable something about a mother
which men and women feel? It&#8217;s
well for a nation to have a Mother&#8217;s
Day; it&#8217;s well for those who celebrate
this day to stop and think what kind
of man or woman their mothers would
like them to be. As a mother, I know
that above all things, what we desire
for our children is clean-mindedness
and honesty. We know that if all
our children had that, much of the
old world&#8217;s misery would dissolve and
disappear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>Just take one thing which may seem
small, but it&#8217;s of vast importance.
Do you believe that if women had
been voting as long as men that we
should have allowed almost the most
important people in the country to be
underpaid? I mean the teachers.
Any woman who has children or who
deals with other people&#8217;s children
realises what infinite patience, tact,
love and long-suffering it takes to
train and teach children properly.
They also realise that they, the teachers
and mothers of the nations, are
forming the mind of the nation. And
yet <i>all</i> nations have left teachers in a
rut for years and years, and allowed
them to toil for a mere pittance. If
women had been voters and organised
voters, this would never have happened!</p>

<p>I urge the League of Women Voters
not to disband and go into parties
yet awhile. Naturally, you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
vote with parties, and later on you
will very likely get tied up like men
into parties, but I don&#8217;t feel that the
time is ripe. As women we must
have organisation to educate ourselves,
not on party lines, but on
national lines. Raise the programme
of all parties; that is what you are
doing now. I beg you to keep on.
The Democrats and Republicans will
both try to catch you. Don&#8217;t let
them catch you napping. Don&#8217;t become
just fodder for political cannon.
Form your programme and make all
the parties adopt it. Begin in your
home towns, begin at once. Get
your politics straight. The only way
to get cleaner and better politics is to
come out and work. In Chicago, we
hear just now of bombs. Well, I
personally fear bombs in politics far
less than I do apathy. If Chicago&#8217;s
citizens are thinking first and foremost
of money-making, then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
politicians who represent them will be
true to type. If they think first and
foremost of higher things, they will
get better politicians. You and I
get pretty much what we deserve in
life, be it political or otherwise.</p>

<p>I believe Chicago has a great heart
as well as a great head. I always
mistrust people who make the most
noise. Beware of men and women
who are out for themselves. That&#8217;s
what keeps us all back&mdash;that awful
self. Yet these people very often
frighten politicians. I am told not to
mention this or that subject in Chicago,
especially the League of Nations.
Now, if there is one city in
America where one should talk of the
League of Nations&mdash;surely it&#8217;s Chicago.
Look at your population. It&#8217;s
a City of Nations in itself. When
you welcome other nationalities here,
you want them to be good citizens.
Do you believe that a man who forgets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
his mother is a good citizen? I don&#8217;t.
So it is with men if they forget their
motherland. The war is nearly over&mdash;we
never want another war. Some
of us feel that if we could get a league
of all nations together, we would go a
long way toward preventing another
war. And we are quite right in
thinking it. The present League of
Nations, even without America, Germany
or Russia, has prevented three
minor wars already, besides doing
many other things. Just to-day we
read in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>&mdash;&#8220;League
Draws Silesian Thorn Out of Europe.&#8221;
This brings to an end a dispute which
nearly led to war between Germany,
Poland, and other nations:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Germany and Poland, through the good offices
of the League of Nations, have ended
their dispute over the rich Silesian coal and
iron basin.</p>

<p>They will sign a treaty of settlement providing
for unified administration of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
industrial district by a mixed commission to-morrow
afternoon in the presence of the council
of the League of Nations.</p>

<p>This is regarded as the greatest achievement
of the League, with the possible exception of
the international court project, for it brings to
an end a dispute which nearly led to war between
Germany and Poland, precipitated a
local revolution, almost split the Allies asunder
when Prime Minister Lloyd George and
Premier Briand had their famous controversy
and has held back Europe&#8217;s industrial recovery
materially because of the unsettled conditions
it caused.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do you mean to tell me that the
Germans and Poles in Chicago don&#8217;t
want a league which will help their
countries? I don&#8217;t believe it. Don&#8217;t
forget also that the Irish, under the
treaty recently made by Great Britain,
can be represented in the League
of Nations. But it can never be a
real League until all nations are in.</p>

<p>So I appeal to all real citizens of my
native country to urge upon this,
the greatest federation of states the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
world has ever known, to coöperate
with the greatest commonwealth of
nations (the British Empire) which
the world has ever known.</p>

<p>Let us give all less fortunate countries
a chance. Let us be tender to all
who suffer. Let our help go out to
them in their need. The world needs
the Anglo-Saxon ideals now. Don&#8217;t
be afraid of joining a league of peace.
Be afraid <i>not</i> to join. The greater
love is winning all the way down the
line. The religions of the world are
being judged by their fruits. The religion
which makes men love all mankind;
the religion where God is love,
whose followers are loving, is the religion
which will draw all men into it.
Hate of any man or of any nation is a
poison which kills. Women mistrust
all who hate, all who preach or teach
hate. In the name of God, who is
Love, let us remember that by our
fruits shall we be judged. Let us see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
that they are the fruits of the spirit,
which are love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
and patience.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">NOTHING I can put into words
can ever make you Canadians
realise what it means to me&mdash;a
returned war veteran&mdash;to get back
to Canada. I am a peculiar person,
and yet I am a fortunate one. The
Good Book says &#8220;the greater the
love, the greater the life,&#8221; and I have
many loves. Being born a Virginian,
I began by loving Virginia first. You
Canadians should also love Virginia.
She gave you some of your common
laws, and Virginia led the way to
America being governed by the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
laws that any country has ever, so far,
invented&mdash;the common laws of England.
When people think&mdash;and voters
should think&mdash;they will see that
every citizen born and living on this
great continent of America owes more
than they know to the men who
fought for freedom in England long
before America was ever thought of
at all. The British fought their first
battle against autocracy in 1214.
King John learnt then what the poor
old Kaiser had to learn in 1918. Let
the whole world remember that the
men who first fought for modern democracy,
fought at Runnymede.</p>

<p>There is nothing in being a Member
of Parliament in any country; we
politicians know that. But there is
something very satisfactory in being
the first woman to represent a constituency
of the fighting men of Devon&mdash;my
second love.</p>

<p>My third love is Canada. I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
love Canada for her hills or plains, or
vast resources, or snowy peaks, or
anything which you read of in guide
books. I love Canada because of her
fifty thousand men who gave their
bodies as a loving sacrifice for their
hills and plains and homes. The only
thing worth loving is unselfishness.
The only thing which mars life is selfishness.
It was at Plymouth I first
saw them land, your Canadian sons,
and it was there that I realised that
heroes away from home take a lot of
watching.</p>

<p>I gave them all that I could, and
how splendidly they accepted it. I
found out there, during the war, that
if you really love people you can say
anything you like to them&mdash;if you
don&#8217;t&mdash;you can&#8217;t say &#8220;Bo&#8221; without
somehow hurting them. I wish you
Canadians could all have seen that
realest bit of Canada in England&mdash;&#8220;Cliveden.&#8221;
We, my husband and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
I, only gave some of the buildings and
the grounds and a few odd things.
The Canadian Red Cross gave the
rest, and I should like to say here in
Ottawa that I saw a great deal of
what all countries did for their soldiers,
and no country did more than
Canada. No hospitals were better
equipped, no doctors more skilled, no
nurses more devoted, and no men
were braver. This may be forgotten
in after-war grievances, but it should
never be.</p>

<p>When I speak of what men stood
from me, perhaps I had better give
you some idea of what they bore with
patience and fortitude. Many times
a month I would give them a temperance
lecture. Temperance lectures
were needed&mdash;in war as well as peace.
I would not begin with: &#8220;Thou shalt
not.&#8221; I began with a picture of
Canada, their mothers, their sweethearts
at home, what they wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and prayed for them. Then I would
paint a picture of what having a
&#8220;grand time&#8221; meant&mdash;drink, women,
etc., and then the awful consequences
which so often followed a &#8220;grand
time&#8220;&mdash;sometimes prison, sometimes
worse than prison, nearly always
misery. They would listen because
they knew I cared. I did care&mdash;and
I still care. That&#8217;s why I am in
politics. One boy came up to me as
he was going on leave, after one of my
horrible talks, gave me his money
and said: &#8220;Here, Mrs. Astor, you&#8217;ve
just ruined my holiday.&#8221; I might
have ruined what he thought would
be a good holiday, but I realised I
had done what his mother wanted me
to do.</p>

<p>I only did what hundreds of English
women did for your sons. I never
like speaking of war without speaking
of what the women did. I know what
Canadians who got the chance did&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
women ever did better. In England
the whole nation had the chance
and the whole nation took it. No,
not the whole nation. Some wrote
diaries. The people who wrote diaries
in the War&mdash;well, they wrote
diaries! Never judge the people of
England by the people who wrote
diaries!</p>

<p>But war is over; the men have
gone; they can&#8217;t come back. The
question is&mdash;will their spirits go
&#8220;marching on&#8221;? One looks round
the world and wonders if they have
died in vain. They did not die in
vain; but they will unless we, with
their unselfishness, go &#8220;marching on.&#8221;
America started the idea of a league
of nations. Some persons for political
purposes, started the idea that a
league of nations would make American
mothers send their sons across
the sea to fight for unheard-of countries.
All countries are alike in this&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
all have a vast amount of ignorant
voters and prejudiced politicians,
always playing the political game.
All countries have some apathetic
people who are frightened of being
drawn into public life; but let us
thank God that all countries have
some people of high ideals, true
patriotism and sound sense&mdash;people
who, having adopted the religion of
Christ in its various forms, remember
the Tenth Chapter of St. Luke, and
feel they can&#8217;t pass on as the Priest
and Levite did, for they feel that
those that lie stripped and wounded
are their concern. Those are the
people who will save Christian civilisation
as we know it, not the civilisation
we see, but as it might be. Even as
it is, it is far better than any civilisation
so far tried. You may say that
this is idealism. Well, we have tried
materialism and it has very nearly
wrecked civilisation; another time it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
will&mdash;so it ought. Civilisation based
on materialism has been wiped out
before, and pray God it always will
be. So don&#8217;t let us be afraid of trying
more idealism. I have spoken to many
thousands of people in America. I
can&#8217;t pretend to know all the problems
of America; they are enormous.
I only pretend to know a little, and
that little is more than some politicians
know, but they will know when
it is too late. Now when politicians
lack a great principle to fight for they
have to fall back on something that
will stir the popular imagination. In
a country with a mixed population
that is easy enough&mdash;there are some
politicians in America who would be
willing to win on any anti-British
policy. Some people in America
would try to misrepresent the League
of Nations as a league started in
England by England, for the benefit
of the British Empire; they know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
perfectly well that it is not true, and
politicians, like people, who are not
telling the truth, are playing a losing
game. I don&#8217;t say that they will lose
at once, but lose they will. All politicians
and all nations who appeal to
prejudice, hate, and self-preservation,
which is only a form of selfishness,
have missed the new spirit, the spirit
of hundreds of thousands of men
whose souls go &#8220;marching on.&#8221; They
are not so far away as some would
think. These men belong to all
countries, enemy as well as Allies.
In the hearts of mothers of all countries
the seeds of peace are sown.
They are dumb as yet in some countries,
they are apathetic in others,
but, mark me, they are there.</p>

<p>Women are young at politics, but
they are old at suffering; soon they
will learn that through politics they
can prevent some kinds of suffering.
They will face the political issue as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
they have faced all others when called
upon; few men have tried their
mothers and found them wanting, and
nearly all men have tried their
mothers at some time. If women
will only do their own thinking and
base that thinking on Christ&#8217;s teaching,
I feel that our entry into politics
will be worth while. We are the
mothers of nations. If we individually
judge our neighbours by their best
and not their worst, the nation will
do the same.</p>

<p>Canada has a great future; Canada
more than any country can prove to
America that the British Empire is
based on laws which strive to be fair
to all men and women, and do harm
to none. Canada, with her French
and English living in peace and legislating
together can show that the
Entente need never go. And Canada,
too, can help me to explain to England
that those who bark the loudest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
America are those who least understand
the best and most real in
America, and very often are not
Americans at all. All nations can
have great futures, but all greatness
can only be founded on what is truly
great. Your fifty thousand Canadians
have shown the way; let us
never forget that the greatest Way-shower
of all came teaching us to do
unto others as we would they should
do unto us. The nations that do
that will conquer all opposition, surmount
all obstacles and secure the
only true greatness.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">EDUCATION is a dangerous
thing unless it is started on
the right lines. To start educating
yourself for yourself is certainly
one of the most misleading or mistaken
forms of self-improvement.
Real education should educate us out
of self into something far finer&mdash;into
a selflessness which links us with all
humanity. Political education should
do the same. The more I see of life
the more I see that the only way is
the narrow way and broad view.</p>

<p>When I landed here in New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
about six weeks ago I expected to
make two speeches and then go to
Virginia and renew my youth. I
have made altogether forty speeches&mdash;I
spent only eleven days in Virginia
and my youth has obviously not been
renewed. However, in spite of talking,
I have learned a lot&mdash;I have found
out what a glorious thing it is to belong
to two countries and try to be
prejudiced against none. I&#8217;ve learned,
too, how well all countries and all
states think of Virginia, and well
they might. It was in Virginia that
the first laws of the best law-makers
in the world were put into practice
on this North American Continent&mdash;the
common laws of England. It&#8217;s a
wonderful tribute to these laws when
one thinks of how well they have
worked away from the little island
on which they were started. Changed
and improved, if you will, but always
the same. Here we see all kinds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
people from all kinds of countries,
living uncommonly well and peacefully
under these common laws. They
seem almost like the Divine law in
that they embrace all sorts and conditions
of men.</p>

<p>The great merit of these common
laws is this: They enable everyone to
work out his own salvation in his
own way. Now, we know that neither
the law nor the state can make a man.
But a good law, and a good state
can go a long way toward helping a
man to make himself. We must
have law, humanity, and Christianity
to make a perfect state. I think we&mdash;and
to-night I speak as a Virginian,
not a British M. P. (so bear with me,
as my time is growing short and I
won&#8217;t speak as a Virginian again for
some time)&mdash;we can feel that we have
built this country on these three&mdash;a
good deal of law, some humanity, and
some Christianity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>Think of what America has taken
on to her shores in the last hundred
years! Now, it was not only humanity
or Christianity which made
us welcome the immigrants, any
more than it was the search of these
two qualities which brought them.
They have come from necessity and
we welcomed them from necessity.
They brought much to the country
and some have taken much away.
It&#8217;s amazing to see how many returned
to their native countries after
a period of about twenty-five years.
In the meantime they have helped
develop the country, and if your
common law and common humanity
and common Christianity has been
brought into action, we will have
helped to develop them, and when
they leave these shores they will
carry away more than mere money.
When we look at Europe to-day we
almost wish we had sent more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>Many of these immigrants make
fine citizens. Just think what Mr.
Straus has done for the infant welfare
of this city. Many never leave the
country again. But many of them&mdash;until
they learn better&mdash;just make a
mass of illiterate voters who are used
by our less fine citizens for political
purposes, and their purposes are not
for the betterment of our country
or any other country, but too often
for a richer and a fuller life in the
worst sense of the word.</p>

<p>Now, I am getting down to political
education&mdash;a thing of vital importance
for every citizen of this country.
This is a very interesting thing and
something that we can be proud of.
Both of our great parties, like most
great parties in all countries, have
their dark sides. It seems that all
countries must go through periods of
political corruption. Some countries
linger in that state longer than others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
We have suffered constantly from
politicians or political crooks, but we
have so managed that no party has
ever dared nominate or bring forward
any man but an honest man as
President&mdash;they haven&#8217;t all been Sir
Galahads, or George Washingtons, or
Abraham Lincolns&mdash;but they have all
been like Cæsar&#8217;s wife&mdash;above suspicion.
That we may recall with
pride. That&#8217;s what I point out,
when I hear people fearing that certain
of our less desirable citizens will
get high office. They just don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>People are so apt to feel apathetic
or indifferent about local politics.
So long as the taxes don&#8217;t go too high
and the local &#8220;bosses&#8221; don&#8217;t get too
rich too quick&mdash;we shrug our shoulders
and go on. I don&#8217;t blame the
local bosses....</p>

<p>This is an extraordinarily interesting
age. But between spiritualists
who see what the dead think and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
psychoanalysts who see what we
don&#8217;t think, one has to be up and
doing. So it is in everything&mdash;in
religion, in business, in games, and in
politics. If we are content to have
only our Presidents fine and to have
less fine local politicians, we are
making it awfully hard for a President
to do fine things. We are simply
making it possible for less fine politicians
to do anything they like. I
don&#8217;t pretend to be an educated
woman, but I have a slight understanding
of human nature and a
positive nose for politics and politicians.
Political education should
begin with the A B C of politics.
It should begin right down low, and
for many of us it should begin right
now. We have here one of the
greatest countries in the world&mdash;it&#8217;s
a country which differs from
any country in Europe, not only
on account of its size and nature and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
natural resources, but because of its
hopefulness.</p>

<p>Pandora never let loose a better
angel thing than when she let loose
the angel of hope. The three things
that have struck me most about
America are its hope, its spirit of
confidence in the future, and its
varied mysterious opportunities. It
has an active and hard-working people,
but added to this it has no outside
cares, it has no great and powerful
neighbours, and no anxiety as to
what they are going to do. You have
no idea what an obsession these things
are in Europe. In Europe the soil
is limited and over-populated; nations
have to depend upon their foreign
trade to find employment and
food for themselves. All the time
they are consumed with fear lest they
should be attacked and their bone
taken from them.</p>

<p>France is naturally afraid of Germany;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Germany of Russia; and England,
though not afraid of her neighbours
any more than America is, is
perpetually anxious lest the whole of
Europe should sink into chaos. Not
only would this intensify unemployment
and bad times, but think of the
added misery of those already suffering
people! In England we can almost
hear the cries of the starving
children of Europe. You here are
far away from all this, and for that
and your innumerable blessings be
thankful. No one asks you to give
up a single blessing, no one even envies
you any of them, but one can
say this&mdash;when you realize your blessings
and know what Europe is,
what will you do?</p>

<p>Will you&mdash;will we&mdash;be like the
Priest and the Levite that pass by
and say &#8220;That starving, bleeding
man is no concern of mine&mdash;it&#8217;s
probably his own fault&mdash;until he gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
up and makes an effort it&#8217;s not my
job to help him. It&#8217;s a revolting
sight and simply spoiled my day&#8221;?</p>

<p>The other way is the way of the
Samaritan. We can help him up,
clean him up, heal him up, and let
him share some of our blessings. I
have no doubt which is the right
policy&mdash;which is in the end the most
paying policy.</p>

<p>The other day I saw that the American
Government asked the British
Government to help protect her oil
interests in Mesopotamia through the
League of Nations. I am glad to say
she did it. Soon after I saw that the
Allies sent a note asking America to
join them and inquire into atrocities
against a Christian population. America
refused. I ask you which is the
more important in the end, oil concessions
or bleeding humanity.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#8217;t want to leave here
having said anything to hurt any person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
or party. All persons and all
parties have been much too kind to
me. There&#8217;s enough trouble in the
world to make one dread adding an
ounce to it. But I should like just to
say before leaving that I think the
politician who, because of lack of
principle, feels that he must appeal
to prejudices or hatred&mdash;class, national,
or international&mdash;is playing a
losing game. They have missed the
new spirit, and I believe as firmly as
I ever believed anything that there
is a new spirit abroad. It may be
that this World War has set us thinking.
It may be that women are the
leaven in the lump, but as certainly
as the Kaiser found might was not
right in 1918, the politicians or
parties who think that they will win
out on prejudice or anti-British or
anti-German or anti-what you will
propaganda are doomed to failure.
They may not fail at once, but fail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
they will. A mind that hates is a
mind that is sick, and a mind which
boasts of itself is as a frog which
puffeth itself up. Only the mind
which is genuinely out to help all
humanity is the kind of mind which
deserves and will get the support of
all the right kind of people.</p>

<p>Playing politics may be all right
when there is nothing seriously wrong
with the world. Just now the human
race needs human beings and not boss
politicians. Quacks are failing all
the world over and fundamentals are
winning, and the safe policy for politicians
and nations is not to do others,
but to do unto others as you would
they should do unto you.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>A fool without fear is sometimes wiser
than an angel with fear.</i>&#8221;</p>


<p class="drop-cap">IT WAS very kind of the English
Speaking Union and the League
of Nations Union American Committee
to have thought of giving me
this welcome. It was particularly appropriate
that they should have asked
the First Lord of the Admiralty to
preside, and gracious of him to come.
You see, if I have done any good in
any way in public life, it&#8217;s due to the
men and women of England&#8217;s most
famous port&mdash;Plymouth. I think we
can safely call it the most historical
port in the world for two reasons:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
first, it was off Plymouth that the
Armada was defeated. That may
seem just a big sea-fight of ancient
days. It was not thought so by the
enemy at the time. They knew what
it meant. It meant that England
would be free to worship God in her
own way&mdash;not free enough for some,
but far freer than any other place in
the world at that time. Then, from
Plymouth, those who found their more
advanced ideas about religious freedom
hampered, sailed away to America,
where they carried on their English
traditions of freedom. There, in
course of time, all men from all
countries found freedom to worship
God in their own way. I think it
would have shocked them had they
realised that some whom they welcomed
to their shores would preach
hate in the name of God toward the
country from which they came; yet
that is what they have done, some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
these people who went to America.
They have not understood that true
freedom can never come to a man or
a nation that hates. I, personally,
have never feared people who preach
hate&mdash;never&mdash;and in 1918 I was
proved right. The nation which
hated most was most handsomely defeated.
The people in America who
preach hate will also some day be
defeated, and I don&#8217;t believe their
days is far off.</p>

<p>I am an unregenerate Anglo-Saxon,
not because I am a Virginian-born
British M. P., not because I care so
desperately for the British Empire or
the United States, but because I care
for something even greater than these
two great countries. I care for civilisation
based on Christianity. I&#8217;ll admit
that I have not seen much of it
yet, but I&#8217;ve seen glimpses of it, and
I&#8217;ve seen thousands of men lay down
their lives because it seemed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
nearest right. It seemed nearer right
than the belief that might is right.
They had a vision, and that vision
goes on. It&#8217;s in many a heart, and
it&#8217;s the hope of the world. Other
countries have visions, but no other
countries in the world have fought and
won so many battles for freedom as
the English-speaking peoples. The
Reformation, it is true, began in
Germany, but it was in England that
its spirit flourished. Anglo-Saxonism
stands to me for true freedom,
spiritual progress, high moral ideals,
and a great sense of service. It is
based on the fatherhood of God and
the brotherhood of man. I know we
fail miserably to carry out our high
ideals, but we have no illusions about
our virtue when we do fail. We
don&#8217;t talk nonsense about the superman
or our thwarted souls. We
know every one of us well enough
right from wrong. We have an ideal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and if we will only listen to our consciences
we realise that the Kingdom
of God is within us, and it&#8217;s our
failure, not God&#8217;s, if this Kingdom
seems so far away.</p>

<p>Now there must be people in all
nations who feel like this, but I believe
that there are more people in the
English-speaking countries who have
been taught this than in any other
countries. They have been taught a
progressive Christianity. They have
been taught to think for themselves,
and that is why I am so keen that
these two great nations should not
only go on thinking for themselves,
but should think how to help all
mankind. To be great for ourselves
is the poorest sort of greatness. It
is pitiful, because it is not great at all.</p>

<p>I now finish my sermon on Anglo-Saxon
idealism, and turn to facts as
I have found them in America. I am
not here to speak of England; I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
that for one month in America. To-night
I am here to speak of America,
and I can do so with as much pride and
confidence as to her greatness as I
spoke of England&#8217;s in America. Let no
one mistake America&#8217;s greatness&mdash;her
greatness of heart. That&#8217;s what
struck me most forcibly from the first
time I spoke there. You may not realise
that my first speeches in America
were on the need of America&#8217;s coming
into a league of peace. I spoke
frankly and tried to point out why she
was needed&mdash;that it was just because
of the entanglements of Europe and
her own happy fate and freedom from
these entanglements that she, above
all other nations, had such a chance
to help on the peace of the world. No
one desires to get any one else into
entanglements, but we long to disentangle
the entangled. If America
had been able to stay in on the reparation
question, with no axe of her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to grind, we all feel that the world
might have been in a better position
now&mdash;international markets might
have been more prosperous and fewer
children might have been starving.
We can&#8217;t blame any country for
thanking God that she is not entangled
in the European chaos, but
we must count on the wise people of
all countries to help to put the tangle
straight.</p>

<p>Everywhere I went in America I
spoke of the League of Nations.
Everywhere I found hundreds and
thousands of people eager to help along
a league of peace. Much in this
league of nations has been misunderstood
and misrepresented in America.
The Covenant became mixed up with
party politics at election time. Millions
of Americans seemed to favour
some modified league of peace. I am
sure this country has never considered
the League perfect or above amendment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and I believe that changes could
be made which would improve the
efficiency of the League and which
would at the same time make international
coöperation acceptable in
America. I may be wrong, I do not
think so. Many in America have
been frightened by certain clauses.
They fear they might be drawn into
European wars&mdash;as though England
with her nine hundred thousand dead
would ever join any league except to
avoid wars. If certain clauses are unacceptable
to America, let us change
those clauses. No league can succeed
unless it is based on mutual trust.</p>

<p>In America I tried to make them
see that it was neither their money nor
their sons, but their great moral support
which was needed. I think myself
that they realise it, thousands of
them. The foreign-born American
can hardly fail to see that the best way
to help the country he has left is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
vote for a real league of nations,
which will include all nations. The
League of Women Voters, which represents
millions of women, is overwhelmingly
in favour of some league
of peace. Women of all countries
want peace because we pay so heavily
in war. There are women of all
countries in America, and I feel sure
they will work toward peace. They
may give a lead to the men. They
can if they will, and I feel that they
will. America is bound to have a
foreign policy if she has a Mercantile
Marine! The thinking men and women
realise that, and it&#8217;s only the
thinkers in any country that count.
They are thinking hard in America,
thinking so hard that they are playing
havoc with the old Party machines.
They are bound to be broken
unless they represent the soul of the
country. I don&#8217;t believe that America
cares more for oil concessions than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
for bleeding humanity. Certain interests
may, but they exist in all
countries.</p>

<p>If the Press of the country is any
indication of the thought of the country,
then we can rejoice when we read
the American Press. Not the Personal
Press. The Personal Press in
all countries is very much alike and
very misleading&mdash;in fact, it is a curse
to any country. It&#8217;s no good the reporters
taking this down for most of
their employers won&#8217;t publish it.
One reads the Press for news, true
news and facts, not to have the news
tainted by the personal prejudices
of the owner. Unfortunately some
newspaper owners don&#8217;t realise this,
but we, who read their papers, can
only pity them and pray for better
times. Now the Associated Press of
America is a shining light in the
country, because it tries to put true
European news before the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Mr. Melville Stone, and the gentlemen
who helped him to build up the Associated
Press deserve, and some day
will get, the gratitude of the world.
True international news is what we
need to know to-day. I was much
struck with the good European news
that once got in the American Press.
Over here, except for a few commendable
exceptions, one would almost
think that America was made up of
bootleggers, drunken society girls,
and cinema scandals. If that were
true, it would be far better that
America should never come into a
league of nations. But that kind of
news does not represent the country:
it is only true of those people who add
to no country&#8217;s greatness, and unfortunately
are to be found in all countries.</p>

<p>I could talk to you for hours of my
travels, and the wonderful kindness
shown me wherever we went. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
so unexpected. I never started on a
mission; I never knew that America
would be so interested in what England
had done and was trying to do.
They warned me not to speak of the
League of Nations, but I found that a
fool without fear is sometimes wiser
than an angel with fear. I had to
speak of what was in my heart. No
one could have lived through these
last seven years and not had their
hearts either broken, hardened, or
just made larger. I tried to tell them
about English sailors and soldiers,
and above all English women. Many
could have done it better, but I feel
that England&#8217;s greatness lies, perhaps,
in her reticence. No English-born
M. P. could have spoken out so. I
had an unique opportunity, and sometimes
when I feared I should fail, I
remembered my friends in Flanders
fields, and that gave me courage.
However, it doesn&#8217;t take great courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to speak out what you feel is the
truth to people, particularly if they
are your own people. It&#8217;s a wonderful
thing to belong to two great
countries, but it&#8217;s even more wonderful
to feel that the hearts and desires
of these two countries are striving for
what is best and what is right. It
may take time before America comes
into her own, but her own is clear to
me. She cannot live up to her high
ideals if she tries to live to herself
alone. I don&#8217;t believe she wants to
do it. She proved it at the Washington
Conference. She had the chance
to build the greatest navy in the
world. She gave it up with as much
grace as the greatest navy in the
world gave up her long reign of the
seas. There they showed the rest of
the world how great they were.
Sometime, somehow, America will
confer again, and that will be to
help the whole world, as England is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
so bravely trying to do almost alone
now&mdash;to show men that her foundations
are built on peace on earth and
good-will toward all men.</p>

this glorious old town will strive to

or partial affection. That&#8217;s
what I tried to do in America. I
never did half as well as I should
have liked, but at least I did the best
I knew how.</p>

<p>My American trip will always remain
a mystery to me. A mystery
and an inspiration. As you know,
I never went out on a mission; I was
not quite so egotistical as that. I
went to speak to the League of Women
Voters. They asked me, and I
realised that, being Virginian born
and a British M. P., I might be able
to explain to them a little some of the
outstanding characteristics of the
British. I could stand before them
as an emblem of British Justice. You
all must know that a certain section
of the Irish in America (and only a
section&mdash;many of the Irish-Americans
are among the best and most highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
respected citizens) have made hatred
of England not only a plank in their
religious teachings, which is the greatest
of <i>all</i> crimes (for it is a crime to
teach hate in the name of God who
is Love), but they have also made it
a political issue. They are highly
organised, and not a silent body by
any means. They have grossly misrepresented
England, but I think
they have over-rated their powers.
To hear them talk you would think
that England was a monster of greed
and injustice. Their propaganda is
subtle, but it is not really convincing.
I think it is killing itself. It is a
poor thing to preach hatred and it
is almost suicidal to nourish it. It is
a losing doctrine and is bound to lose,
if God is true and God is love. I am
not afraid of those who preach hate&mdash;be
it class, national, or international,
for I believe that hate is a blind force,
and that the truth about everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
finally works through, though it
takes time. This to me is one of the
fundamental facts of civilisation. We
are slowly but surely progressing
nearer and nearer reality.</p>

<p>However, that is not what I came
here to talk about. I am here to try
to tell you of my trip. In the first
two speeches I made, I spoke of
England&mdash;her high ideals and desire
to help the whole world. I spoke of
the common bond between America
and Great Britain, that bond I believe
to be a common purpose of
Peace on earth and good-will toward
all men. I reminded them of what
a great part the British Navy had
played in making what civilisation
we have. I don&#8217;t believe that any
other country in the world but England
or America, with the greatest
navy in the world, would have
used it always for purposes of peace.
I&#8217;ll admit that before America was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
settled the navy under Drake was not
exactly a missionary society, and yet
it did missionary work, and made it
possible for English ideals to go forth
and spread the whole world over. I
told them with as much pride as
though I, personally, had bidden
godspeed to Francis Drake and seen
that his powder was dry.</p>

<p>I should remind you that Drake is
as much a part of Virginian history
as of England&#8217;s.</p>

<p>I spoke of the League of Nations,
and how it could never be a real
League without America, and that
America&#8217;s greatness would never be
true unless she helped the whole
world; in fact, I just spoke out. I
would have understood had they
said: &#8220;This woman talks too freely;
we don&#8217;t want to hear any more of
what she has got to say.&#8221; I would
have understood that; but they didn&#8217;t
do that. After my first two speeches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
we got wires from all over America,
from all kinds of associations and
people asking us to speak&mdash;business
men, Chambers of Commerce, colleges,
etc.&mdash;that&#8217;s the wonderful part
of the whole thing. I dared speak of
England and the League of Nations,
and of the pity that America should
not be in, and they still wanted to
hear. I have always felt that not
only are America&#8217;s laws Anglo-Saxon,
but her ideals are Anglo-Saxon, and
I have always felt, too, that until
people from other countries brought
better laws and higher ideals than
my forefathers carried from this country,
that those laws and those ideals
would be accepted, and would govern
and guide all those millions of people
from other nations who came to
America. For the sake of humanity,
one would wish America to accept
better laws and better ideals if she
could find them. I don&#8217;t think she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
has found them yet. She may have
improved them, but the background
and bedrock are the same. Virginia
did improve them, and I was reminded
in Canada that Nova Scotia got her
laws from the Virginians, who had
improved them to suit a young country,
and from these laws a great nation
is springing. Let no one forget
America&#8217;s greatness. She is very
young compared to the Old World.
She may seem precocious&mdash;young
people generally are&mdash;but she cares
about real things, and her heart is as
big as her territory. Ask any one who
goes there, and they nearly all tell
the same story of generous hospitality
and a great sense of friendliness. I,
being American born of only stout
Anglo-Saxon forefathers, would naturally
always love the real America,
but this time I loved her more than
ever, for I saw that my thoughts
about her were right, and I loved her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
for letting me speak of England&mdash;how
she had suffered, how she fought,
and how hopeless she was at ever
speaking of herself. I told them that
perhaps some of her greatness lay in
her reticence. When you do right,
you can afford to be reticent. It is
only people who are doing wrong who
need to be continually talking. I
knew that though ten Englishmen
were being killed in the war for every
two overseas men, to read the papers
one would have thought that only the
overseas men were fighting. So much
was it so, that the German-Americans
tried to use it as a proof of England&#8217;s
selfishness. She saved her own men,
they said, and sent the overseas men
into the worst places. You and I and
the men themselves know better. It
was England&#8217;s dauntless chivalry
which made her give first place in her
accounts of the battles to her gallant
sons who came so far to help her.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>Then I tried to tell them what
English women did&mdash;how they bore
it all; and just worked and smiled and
helped their sons when they came
from America. You here in Plymouth
know all about that, for you
did it so well. You bound many a
Yankee with your West Country
kindliness. They won&#8217;t forget. I
went back and reminded them that
English Kings found out in 1214 at
Runnymede what the Kaiser only
discovered in 1918. I reminded them
that long before they set sail to settle
America, Englishmen were fighting
for freedom. They let me say all
this, and they listened and were very
kind.</p>

<p>And so we travelled far and wide,
the two Plymouth M. P.&#8217;s of the
Upper and Lower Houses. The
Member of the Upper House was a
far greater success than the member
of the Lower House. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
slightly prepared for my democratic
outlook, but they were totally unprepared
for his. Imagine their surprise
when they found him more
progressive and democratic than most
of the people that they saw about
them.</p>

<p>Before I leave America, I must tell
you that my welcome in Virginia was
best of all&mdash;Virginia, England&#8217;s first
child and my first home. All I can
tell you here at Plymouth about Virginia
is this: I got a Plymouth man
a job in Virginia, and I saw him when
I got back home and he said: &#8220;Lady
Astor, you are right about Virginia.
I didn&#8217;t feel a bit away from Devon
here. It&#8217;s just like home.&#8221; And so
I feel about Plymouth. It, too, to
me is just like home. There&#8217;s the
same sort of naturalness about Virginians
as there is about Devonians.
We both have fine traditions, and perhaps
we are both a little slow. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
rest of the countries may pick out
many faults in us, but they can also
pick out many pages of history that
would not have been written without
us.</p>

<p>We went from New York to Baltimore,
Washington, Philadelphia, Virginia,
then Chicago&mdash;a wonderful
place&mdash;and everywhere we found a
great spirit of hope. It really seems
a land of hope. Then we went to
Canada. Everyone in Canada was
kind, from the Prime Minister down,
and most of my friends were down.
They appeared all along the railway
on the train from Ottawa to Montreal.
When I was trying to rest a
bit I heard at a wayside station two
familiar voices&mdash;&#8220;Hurry up and come
out, Mrs. Astor, we&#8217;ve come a long
way to see you.&#8221; There they were&mdash;two
of the Canadian soldiers from the
Hospital at Cliveden. Virginia and
Canada did give me a very personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
kind of welcome; so much so that I
can&#8217;t really speak of it, but I told them
I realised that in thanking me, they
were just thanking all the women of
England who had worked so hard for
their sons.</p>

<p>Now I don&#8217;t want you to think
that we took this trip for any personal
purpose; that wouldn&#8217;t have been
worth while, and yet it turned out
to be for a purpose&mdash;a purpose far
above anything so small as a personality&mdash;things
we believed in, not
what we had attained. But we saw
we had a chance to speak the kind of
things that would unite, and we took
it; and I firmly believe that some day
we shall see the British Empire and
America not bound together by any
treaty&mdash;they may never sign any
agreement&mdash;that won&#8217;t matter, but
seeing things as they saw them at
Washington. There are so many
people in these two countries who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
working for what is greater than all
nations&mdash;Civilisation based on Christianity.
I know you may look around
and say we have very little civilisation
and even less Christianity; yet we
have a nucleus, a leaven perhaps,
and some day it will leaven the whole.
You may rightly say bitter things
about America not coming into the
League of Nations&mdash;no more bitter
things than I heard some Americans
say. I can&#8217;t pretend to say that
America will come into this League
of Nations. I am no prophet; but
I would stake my very life that some
day and some hour America will come
into some sort of League of Peace&mdash;not
to protect herself, but to protect
the peace of the world. I know that
there are hundreds and thousands of
men and women in America who are
striving for what is best and right in
civic, national, and international life.
There are people in all countries with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
vision, and they keep the rest from
perishing. America is no more a
mere country of business men than
England is a nation of shop-keepers.
We do business and we keep shops,
but we don&#8217;t end there. That&#8217;s only
where we begin. The countries who
taunt us with that find, when there&#8217;s
famine in the world, American business
men and English shop-keepers
are the first to help.</p>

<p>To-day is Independence Day in
America. Little American children
are burning their fingers with fire
crackers. American orators are burning
their audiences with oratory.
They are speaking of America&#8217;s great
fight for Independence. Let us all
remember that the American War of
Independence was fought by British
Americans against a German King and
a reactionary Prime Minister for British
ideals, and that a large part of the
British nation sympathised with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
rebels. The same old British fighting
always for freedom! The great
American of that day was a Virginian&mdash;George
Washington. Some
one described him as one of England&#8217;s
greatest sons. He was a Virginian
with only British blood&mdash;I am just
the other way around&mdash;a British
M. P. with only Virginian blood. I am
no leader, no general, and no statesman,
but I hope I am a fighter, especially
when it&#8217;s a fight for peace.
Many of us believe that until the
British Empire and America get together
and lead the world in Peace&mdash;Peace
will be a long time coming.
We feel, too, that in fighting for
understanding between these two
countries we are fighting for something
far greater than any one country&mdash;for
a civilisation based on Christianity.</p>

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
